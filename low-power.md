Benefits of Our Low-Power FPGAs

Microchip FPGAs and SoC FPGAs consume up to 50% lower total power than competitive FPGAs. Our nonvolatile process delivers FPGA families that are live at power-up with minimal in-rush current, and significantly lower leakage than SRAM-based alternatives. Take it one step further; run a power benchmark with our power estimator.
